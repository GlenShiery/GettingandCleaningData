Getting and Cleaning Data 



These files are part of the Getting and Cleaning Data assignement Week 4.

The run_analysis.R file contains a R script that will tidy the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
Place the unzipped data in a working directory. Edit the script (line 20) to recognise the location of your working directory.
The Tidy'ed data will be written to this working directory.


The CodeBook.md contains some fast information on the data.

Thank you
